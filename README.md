# youtube_stats

Work in progress

Grabs user's videos and inserts most of the video stats into a dataframe

In the dataframe I calculate different ratios between mostly the date since
it was uploaded and number of likes, comments, dislikes the video reserved.

I also make pretty graphs that show how active the user is uploading videos.

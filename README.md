Work in progress

When looking at a user's youtube video page, finding popular videos by that author is difficult. Youtube offers
sorting videos by view count and date published. In this program I have utlilized the view count along with
likes, dislikes, and comment count to make finding the most interesting video easier.

You can also find videos via the search method so you are not limited to one user's videos.

I would like to incorporate tags (up too 10 words defined by the user), title, description, and
thumbnail of video. 

I also make pretty graphs showing the different ratios over time. And also how active the user
is uploading videos.

I bleeped out my API key. If you have trouble getting your YouTube Data API v3 key from:
https://console.developers.google.com let me know and I can send you mine.
